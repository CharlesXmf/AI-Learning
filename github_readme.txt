Data Collection from Github using API *

PyGitHub is a Python library to access the GitHub REST API. This library allows you to manage GitHub resources such as repositories, user profiles, and organizations in your Python programs.

You need to use the “pip” command to install the “PyGithub” package via the Windows command prompt.
pip install PyGithub

Obtain your API key from Github

Use Notepad to create and execute the Python data collection program. The sample program retrieves the “Readme” document about how to use anonymous IP technique to retrieve Facebook data from a Github user’s “18520339” repository/project. 

The initial program always asks you to enter your Github API key. This is cumbersome because you know what your API key is. So we modify the sample program such that your new program can automatically retrieve the same README file without asking you to enter the API key each time.
